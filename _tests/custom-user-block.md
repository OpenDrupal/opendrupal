### Challenge Overview 

__Create a Drupal module which displays a block of users.__

Skills required: A knowledge of PHP, including [functions](http://php.net/manual/en/functions.user-defined.php), some basic [control structures](http://php.net/manual/en/language.control-structures.php) and an understanding of the Drupal database API (at a minimum how to use [Static queries](https://www.drupal.org/node/310072)) and how to programmatically display a block.

### The Challenge

1. Create a new Drupal module which displays a block.
2. Now create a separate PHP function that queries the database and returns the last 5 users to register on the website.
3. Call the custom function you've created to show the last 5 users in the block.
4. Add this to a region in the Drupal theme.

### The Test

1. Create two new users in the Drupal site and see that they appear in the block.
2. You'll be asked to talk through the code and show how you would modify it to show alternate information.


### The Rules

* You can use Google as much as you like to find information.
* You must start the module from scratch - you cannot copy & paste an entire previous module you've worked on.
* You can copy & paste small code snippets you find in online documentation to use as a basis for your own code.
