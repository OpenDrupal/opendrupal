Contributing
------------

Open Drupal is entirely open source! It's build by the community and your contribution is vital. 

* Any contributions are welcome! If it's a suggestion, a minor edit or helping write some content.
* Look through the [issue queue](https://github.com/OpenDrupal/opendrupal/issues) for existing issues.
* Read through the [learning module template](template.md) to see how to write or edit a learning module.
* All edits should be made as pull requests. This can be done directly from the GitHub editing interface.
