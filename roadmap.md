Roadmap
-------

__Main aim:__ Free and open source training material by way of The Open Drupal Curriculum.
__Secondary aims:__ Support local training programmes and provide tools to help training and learning Drupal.

## Goals

*Immediate*

* Complete version 1 of the curriculum (using markdown files in Github), which will be used for the UK Drupal Apprenticeship qualification and any other training that people want to use it for.
* Restructure opendrupal.org, see [this issue](https://github.com/OpenDrupal/opendrupal/issues/26)

*Future*

* Build a frontend for the curriculum, to display the markdown files in a nicer way (probably using a static-site generator).
* Integrate with Mozilla's Open Badges.

Version 2 of the curriculum:

* Include training for Drupal 8.
* Decouple the curriculum from the training materials by writing more comprehensive aims & learning objectives.
* Clearer instructions on implementing and contributing to The Open Drupal Curriculum.


## Ideas

* Build an authentication system, allowing participants to check off areas they have completed.
* Build a custom UI for editing files.
* 'Switches' between learning materials (e.g switches between Drupalize.me, buildamodule.com or free videos).
