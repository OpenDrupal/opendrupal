Roadmap
-------

## Goals

* Complete version 1 of the curriculum using markdown files in Github, which will be used for the UK Drupal Apprenticeship qualification.
* Build a frontend for the curriculum, to display the markdown files in a nicer way.

## Ideas

* Build an authentication system, allowing participants to check off areas they have completed.
* Build a system that allow trainers to easily produce their own modules, units and workshops.
* Build a custom UI for editing files.
* Integrate with Mozilla's Open Badges.
* Figure out how we can make the curriculum translatable in to other languages.
* 'Switches' between learning materials (e.g switches between Drupallize.me, buildamodule.com or free videos).
