Project Setup & Intro to the Toolchain
--------------------------------------

### Preparation

* Print out Open Drupal VM passwords

### What we'll cover today:

* Deciding on a project to work on over the coming workshops, so there is a consistent focus and so you can build something useful and use as evidence.
* Setting up and making sure we're comfortable with our local development environments, so when we use this environments in the future we know what we're doing.
* Using the command line & Drush, as they are widely used developer tools and can make you quicker and access more powerful system features.

### 1. Decide on a project

Intro (1 - 2 hours)

*__Do:__ [/project/01_project_plan.md](Project: plan) module.

* __Checkpoint:__ rename your Google Doc to "Full Project Plan" and save it in a folder called *"Open Drupal - [name]"* replacing [name] with your full name. Now share this folder with the trainer.

### 2. Setup our local development environments

(1 hour)

* __Do:__ Open Drupal VM tutorial, *Tutorials->open_drupal_vm.md*
* Now set up a snapshot at your machine's vanilla state.
* __Checkpoint:__ all have a working local environment and be able to edit our Drupal sites.
* __Group discussion:__ Q&A on virtual machines and local setup, tips & tricks on local development.

### 3. Toolchain: command line

(1 - 2 hours)

* __Group discussion:__ the command line, what is it? Why should we use it (it's quicker and more powerful)?
