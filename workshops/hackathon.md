Hackathon
---------

A hackathon is a great way to build a prototype product quickly. Hackathons take place all over the world in tech communities and many products go on to become real businesses. It’s also a great way to learn new skills and meet new people.

A hackathon day looks like this:

1. Pitching
2. Setting up
3. Planning
4. Prototyping
5. Mid-day demo
6. Building
7. Demo

## Preparation

* Pens & paper for wireframe sketching
* Computers / laptops / tables set up in separate groups

## Scoring Criteria

* Design / UX
* Product idea
* Technical
* Teamwork

## Team Role Ideas

* Designer / themer
* Module developer
* Site builder
* Project manager

## Pitching

* Website ideas are presented - they should be achievable within one day
* Teams of 3 or 4 people form around their favourite ideas

## Setting up

* Decide on team roles
* Set up a Git repository (e.g on BitBucket or GitHub)
* Set up each team member's computer to be able to contribute to the main site
* Set up an online development site if there is time (e.g on Pantheon)
* To get going quickly and not get stuck in set-up, start work on one person’s computer

## Planning

* Decide some of the main modules to use
* Sketch some wireframes
* Prototyping (optional)
* Gather around one computer and start installing modules and configuring the site
* Commit everything to git and all pull down copies
* Mid-day demo
* Before lunchtime ask each team to do a mini-demo of their work

## Building

* Each team member works on a specific task, e.g:
* Themer works on the theme on their computer
* Module developer works on a custom module
* Site builder works directly on the development site
* Project manager ensures nobody is blocked and helps where it is needed

## Demo

* One team member presents and talks through the site to everyone
* The best team wins a prize!

## Rules

* You must start from scratch

## Tips

* Improvise! Use the tools you know
* Don't dig yourself in a hole - be careful not to get stuck fixing bugs for too long. Keep regular backups and make sure you're all working in the same direction.

## Notes for Trainers

* Time is extremely limited so emphasise this throughout the day
* If participants are getting stuck on setup ask them to work on one person’s computer mainly, with others writing code (e.g custom modules and themes) that they can transfer to the main computer - this is a quick and easy way to get stuff done.
