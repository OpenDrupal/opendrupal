The Toolchain Continued & Site Building
---------------------------------------

### Preparation

* @todo

### What we'll cover today:

* Recap the previous workshop
* Start adding some modules and configuration to our sites
* Git basics
* Set up a repository and add our codebase
* Learn about deployment techniques between environments

### 1. Recap: command line, Drush & project plans

* Recap previous workshop: quiz on command line commands & Drush commands.
* Review project plans & update if needed.

### 2. Start building your site

30 Minutes - 1 Hour

* Start building your site by downloading contrib modules you think you'll need, create some content types and add some test content.

### 3. Git Intro

* __Group Discussion:__ What is version control and why do we need it?
* __Do:__ the [/toolchain/03_git.md](Toolchain: Git, part A) learning module section.
* __Group Activity:__ Each draw a diagram of what Git is and how it works.

### 4. Git: Project Repository Setup

* __Do:__ [/toolchain/03_git.md](Toolchain: Git, part B).
* __Checkpoint:__ Share your git repository with your trainer.

### 5. Git: Shared Repository Setup

* __Group Activity:__ 
  * Nominate one person to create a new git repo with a single text file in called ```web_dev_gotchas.md```. Now share this repo with everyone in the group.
  * Now each member of the group should add in at least three tips or things they've learnt about web development.
  * Try to categorise these tips into sections (e.g 'Git', 'Drupal', 'Frontend').
  * Work on the repository collaboratively. If you encounter a merge conflict, open the file and resolve it using a text editor.
* __Pro tip:__
  * Try creating a pull request!

### 6. Deployment

* __Group Discussion:__ The deployment process.
* __Do:__ Write down the different components you need to think about when deploying or migrating sites.

### 7. Backup & Restart

* Backup your Database and code, reset your VMs and re-import your sites.
