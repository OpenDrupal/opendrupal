Notes
=====

## Intro

* Recap previous two workshops
* By this point everyone should be quick at setting up, so set a time limit
on setting up development environments (everyone should take part).

## 1) CSS & Sass

### A. CSS

* Don't worry about setting up Sass at this point, ask that everyone just uses
plain CSS. Sass is always optional for new projects and new technologies will
render it obsolete.
* Recap on everyone's CSS guidelines. If they haven't written them get a basic
one pager up on GitHub.
* Make sure everyone has some designs or design ideas to use for styling their
site. Encourage them to take the challenge of making their site look great.
* For the exercise, there's no need to worry about using any of Sass's features.
* Review all CSS, possibly peer-review. Refer back to guidelines. Discuss why
it's important to write good CSS, what the benefits are.

### B. Sass

* Now make sure everyone is set up with Sass - talk through this as a group and
help each other out.
* Make sure nobody overwrites their CSS now!
* This is an open exercise, it can take plenty of time and be broken up with
open discussions and peer-review throughout. 

## 2) JavaScript & jQuery

* The CodeAcademy courses should be a challenge to see who can complete them
quickly. If they anyone is struggling they should finish in their own time and
be thorough.
* Have a discussion about JavaScript - ask what everyone want to know about it
and discuss.
* Talk about some exciting emerging technologies (e.g React.js, Web Components),
do a demo of some of these.
* If anyone completes the courses quickly they can go on to the optional task
and experiment with these emerging technologies.
