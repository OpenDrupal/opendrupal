Open Drupal Lessons
---------------------

Lessons are collections of useful resources and directions to help achieve the learning outcomes within the curriculum. Work done on projects outside of these lessons will also go toward fulfilling the learning outcomes - these lessons are designed to establish a strong base set of knowledge on web development in Drupal and go into some advanced concepts in detail.

They are currently designed to be used as one day workshops delivered by a trainer to a small group of less than 8. There may be accompanying notes by trainers with them as well.
