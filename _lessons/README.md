Open Drupal Lessons
===================

Lessons are collections of useful resources and directions to help achieve the
learning outcomes within the curriculum. Work done on projects outside of these
lessons will also go toward fulfilling the learning outcomes - these lessons are
designed to establish a strong base set of knowledge on web development in Drupal
and go into some advanced concepts in detail.

They are currently designed to be used as one day workshops delivered by a
trainer to a small group of less than 8. There may be accompanying notes by
trainers with them as well.

The lessons can be re-ordered if it suits the programme they are being used in.

All lessons assume that a participant has gone through all parts of The Open
Drupal Foundation course, or has equivalent knowledge. The lessons are split up
in to five sections.
