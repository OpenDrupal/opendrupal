User Stories
============

Overview
--------
###Here is what we'll be covering:

1. Presentation and discussion of your project idea
2. Personas - the types of user who might use your site
3. Recap user stories and estimation 
4. Initial documentation for your project

###By the end of this lesson you will:

* Have decided on your project and documented the main requirements for it
* Have developed your own user stories with estimations for your project


1) Project Review
-----------------
###Group activity
Present your project idea to the group, let us know what you are thinking of building, who the site is aimed at roughly how you see it working and what modules you are thinking of using. Following each presentation will be a group discussion about your project, a chance for everyone else to feedback on your ideas, ask questions and make suggestions. Appoint a different person for each presentation to keep track of the discussion and record the main points.

### Section Checkpoint

* __Do:__ Write up your project idea as a document saving it to your folder on Google Drive

  Include:
  * A summary of the site
  * The main pages
  * Key Drupal modules
  * Advanced functionality

2) Personas
-----------
Who are the main types of people who will be using your site? We need to know a bit about these users, or groups of users before we can write the story cards. Obviously there will be a main admin user with top level permissions and access but there may be extra admin users to perform special functions too. There will be anonymous users as well - people who have never visited the site before or have not yet signed in but maybe some other groups in between? Here are some examples of user groups and what they might need to do:

###Example
A website for a medium sized company with pages, news items, and contact forms for different departments. They also have a blog section with content provided by members of the public.

* Blogger
  * Create and publish own blog posts
  * See own unpublished blog posts
* Blog Editor
  * Edit, promote, delete all blog posts
  * See all unpublished blog posts
* Press Officer 
  * Create/edit/delete news items
  * See all unpublished news items
  * Schedule News items for future publication
* Site Editor
  * Create/edit/delete pages and webforms
  * See all unpublished content
* User Administrator
  * Grant/revoke user roles
  * Add new users

### Section Checkpoint
* __Do:__ Create a list of the main user groups for your project and the tasks they would want to do - add this to your project documentation.

###Group Activity
Work in pairs or groups of three to come up with at least 10 user stories for your project using the standard structure:

* Title
* Actor
* Narrative
* Goal

####Example
| Actor: | As a | Journalist|
| --- | --- | --- |
| Narrative: | I want to |see contact information relating to the news article I am reading |
| Goal: | So that	| I can get directly in touch with the press office about it|

Once you have 10 or so story cards agree on an estimate using M. David Green's estimation techniques.

### Section Checkpoint
