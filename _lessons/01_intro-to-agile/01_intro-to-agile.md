Team Processes - Agile
======================

This lesson contains an introduction to the concepts of Agile development. This includes the general theory behind agile teams and the agile lifecycle as well as the more specific methdology of Scrum.

Overview
--------
###Here is what we'll be covering:

1. What is Agile? - theory, principles and how it works for web development
2. Iterative development - what it means and how it works
3. Scrum - sprints and roles
4. User stories - to describe what we are going to build
5. Estimation - how we estimate tasks using scores 1 - 5
6. Planning - using Trello for Kanban, more detailed sprint boards and reviews

###By the end of this lesson you will:

* Be able to define your project in terms of user stories
* Provide estimates of for those user stories
* Be able to plan your project in sprints
* Start a kanban board to manage your project

### A. An Introduction to Agile & SCRUM

"Agile software development is a group of software development methods based on iterative and incremental development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing, cross-functional teams. 
It promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development and delivery, a time-boxed iterative approach, and encourages rapid and flexible response to change. It is a conceptual framework that promotes foreseen tight interactions throughout the development cycle."

####SCRUM
@todo add intro to SRCUM
@todo - link to SCRUM slides

* __Product Owner__ – (a role probably performed by the Service manager) responsible for delivering return on investment, usually by creating products that users love
* __Delivery Manager__ (aka Scrum master or project manager) – the agile expert responsible for removing blockers (things slowing a team down), they also act as a facilitator at team meetings
* __Team Members__ – self-organising and multi-disciplinary, they produce user stories, carry out the product manager’s vision and are responsible for estimating their output and speed

* __Read:__ [Agile Manifesto and Principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/)
* __Watch:__ [Agile in a nutshell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIPv-Ym2n1E)
* __Read:__ [An intro to Scrum](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum)
* __Do:__ Write a blog post outlining the principles of Agile development, iteritive development and SCRUM

### B. Gathering Requirements
For agile projects we gather our requirements as 'User Stories' rather than extensive documentation. This allows us greater flexibility.

* __Read:__ [Gov.uk writing user stories](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile/writing-user-stories.html)
* __Do:__ Write between 5 & 10 user stories to describe functionality of a project (use one of the [example projects from the foundation course](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0By9KqisVw_3lTnRSZnVPb2RIMjA)).

### C. Estimation
We estimate user stories (or features or tasks) for its difficluty and value _relatively_ to the other user stories (or features or tasks)

*__Watch:__ [Agile Estimations - from Black Pepper Software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nTxdl29ePY)
* __Do:__ As a group (or individually) come up with estimates (1-5) for all the user stories you created in the last excersise.
