Impact Maps Review
-------------------
Settting out and documenting objectives for projects is fundemntal for making good decisions throughout the development process. It also creates a frame of reference for all the people involved and makes conversations about the project and decisions easier.

###Group Activity
Take it in turns to present your impact map to the group, a chance to get feedback and respond to questions from the rest of the group. Nominate someone to keep notes.


###Group Activity
In pairs or groups of three create empathy maps for some of your key personas.


User Journeys
-------------
Mapping out potential user jouneys is essential in designing and developing a site that delivers on the objectives and goals we set. We need to get the users to the page or area of the site where they can achieve the goal.
